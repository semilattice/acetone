The following tasks are «planned»:

 - Work on a programming language, Epoxy, that follows the same principles as
   Acetone, and features System Fω with row polymorphism and type classes.

 - Add PHP as a target language.

 - Write a project management tool for Semilattice in Epoxy, and develop the
   Epoxy standard library as a part of it. The tool may be called Carbofuran,
   because it is essentially a bug tracker, and we apparently name everything
   after chemicals.
