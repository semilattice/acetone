Acetone
=======

Acetone is a library for
optimizing programs and
translating them into other programming languages.
Acetone may be used as
the final stage in a compilation pipeline.
Acetone is particularly well-suited for
programming languages wherein subroutines are devoid of side-effects.

Acetone implements
an internal representation (IR) for programs,
transformations of programs, and
code generation into target languages.
